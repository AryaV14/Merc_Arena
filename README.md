# Merc Arena

Welcome to the README file for Merc Arena developed with Pygame! This file will provide you with all the information you need to know to get started playing the game.

## Installation
Before playing the game, you will need to have Pygame installed on your computer. Pygame can be installed via pip, a package manager for Python.
