## How it Works ?

In the game, you will control the merc who must defeat his opponents in a sword fight. You will need to use a combination of moves and attacks to defeat your opponent.

The game is won when one player reduces the other's health bar to zero. 
Bottle of potion can be used to restore health. Enemies use their potion once, when their health goes below 50%. No characters can use the health potion if they are dead.

Once the game begins, the merc can give his first strike by choosing the enemy to attack. If you hover the mouse over the enemy the cursor changes to a sword. Click on the enemy to attack.
