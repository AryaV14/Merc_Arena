# Merc Arena

Welcome to the README file for Merc Arena developed with Pygame! This file will provide you with all the information you need to know to get started playing the game.

## Installation
Before playing the game, you will need to have Pygame installed on your computer. Pygame can be installed via pip, a package manager for Python.

To install Pygame, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install python

In the game, you will control a character who must defeat their opponent in a one-on-one fighting match. You will need to use a combination of moves and attacks to defeat your opponent.

The game is won when one player reduces the other's health bar to zero.
